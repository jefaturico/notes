# ENSO Mechanisms

The [El Niño-Southern Oscillation](/pages/el-nino-southern-oscillation.md) is generally explained as either:

- One phase of a self-sustained, unstable, and naturally oscillatory mode of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.

- A stable (or damped) mode triggered by or interacted with stochastic forcing or noise such as westerly wind bursts and Madden-Julian Oscillation events and the tropical instability waves in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

**The ENSO cycle**, based on Rasmusson & Carpenter (1982), Jin (1996) and Van der Waart et al. (2000) is very briefly summarized here.

## From Normal Conditions to El Niño

1. Weakening or reversal of the [trade winds](/pages/easterly-trade-winds.md), often associated with the atmosphere's 30--60 day [Madden-Julian oscillation](/pages/madden-julian-oscillation.md).

2. An oceanic [Kelvin wave](/pages/kelvin-waves.md) shoots eastward along the equator in response.

3. The Kelvin wave transports heat eastward, resulting in warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific.

4. Disruption of the [Walker cirulation](/pages/walker-circulation.md) through sea surface temperature feedback on the atmosphere ([Bjerknes feedback](/pages/bjerknes-feedback.md)).

## From El Niño to La Niña

A negative feedback is needed to turn the coupled ocean-atmosphere system around from an El Niño state back towards a normal or La Niña state. In search of necessary feedbacks for the coupled system, four conceptual ENSO oscillator models have been proposed:

### **Delayed oscillator** (Suarez and Schopf, 1998; Battisti and Hirst, 1989)

1. The Kelvin wave reflects at the eastern boundary and produces westward-popagating [Rossby waves](/pages/rossby-waves.md).

2. The Rossby waves move warm water away from the equator which weakens the equatorial warm sea surface temperature anomaly.

3. The trade winds strengthen a little in response to the somewhat cooler sea surface temperature in the west.

4. The strengthened trades begin pushing the thermocline back towards a normal state.

5. Bjerknes feedback creates a La Niña state.

### Recharge oscillator (Jin, 1997)
- Discharge process due to Sverdrup transport

### Western Pacific oscillator (Weisberg and Wang, 1997; Wang et al., 1999)
- Western Pacific wind-forced Kelvin waves

### Advective-reflective oscillator (Picaut et al, 1997)
- Anomalous zonal advection

### Unified Oscillator (Wang, 2001)

- All of these negative feedbacks may work together for terminating El Niño warming.
