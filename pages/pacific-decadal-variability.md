# Pacific Decadal Variability

In addition to year-to-year variations associated with the [ENSO](/pages/el-nino-southern-oscillation.md), phenomenon, sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific also fluctuate on timescales of decades and longer.

These tropical Pacific decadal sea surface temperature variations are referred to as **Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV)**, also called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) might not be a single physical phenomenon or "mode", but a superposition of several phenomena including ENSO, random atmospheric variability, and oceanic processes.

Analysis techniques that pre-suppose a particular timescale for PDV through band-pass or low-pass filtering may not be isolating any underlying physical phenomenon but simply sampling a continuum of low-frequency variability, albeit with a well-defined geographical pattern.
