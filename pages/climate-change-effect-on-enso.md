# Effect of Climate Change on ENSO

Neither climate models and observation nor proxies provide a conclusive answer on **whether [ENSO](/pages/el-nino-southern-oscillation.md) is going to become stronger or weaker as the tropics [warm up](/pages/human-environmental-impact.md#global-warming) in response to increasing greenhouse gases.**

Climate models project a weak reduction of the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient into the 21st century. However, due to basic equatorial dynamics the adjustment of the thermocline to changes in the [trade winds](/pages/easterly-trade-winds.md) renders the [Bjerknes feedback](/pages/bjerknes-feedback.md) ineffective to amplify an initial El Niño-like warming. For these reasons, a "permanent El Niño" in response to global warming is very unlikely, even if the [Walker circulation](/pages/walker-circulation.md) weakens. Instead, climate models indicate that the equatorial Pacific may just warm up slightly more than the tropics  due to the effect of the weakening of the Walker circulation on equatorial currents and a differential in evaporative damping with the off-equatorial tropics.

No climate models have thus far been able to render ENSO inactive in either warmer or cooler climates.

The projected changes in the mean climate include a shoaled, less tilted, and sharper thermocline; weaker zonal currents; and weaker upwelling.

It is reasonable to hypothesize that depending on the balance of these changes, ENSO could strengthen or weaken.

The east-west SST contrast in the Pacific that we see today may not be a stable and permanent feature. Paleoclimatic records suggest that during the warm early Pliocene (4.5 to 3.0 million years ago) the average SST contrast was about 2ºC, similar to the contrast seen during a modern El Niño event. Because the early Pliocene was warmer than today, this suggests that the equatorial Pacific could see a reduction in east-west SST contrast as the Earth warms up in response to increasing greehouse gases.

!! Available Pliocene records show that ENSO frequency and amplitude were not significantly different from today.
