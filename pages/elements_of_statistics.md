# Elements of Statistics

The **core elements of statistics** are the most basic, fundamental components that make up the field of [statistics](statistics).

## Population
A **population** is any **set of values** from which you are interested in obtaining information. Usually a population implies a very large or otherwise inaccessible set of values.

## Sample
A **sample** is a subset of the population acessible to you via sampling, and the dataset from which the information is actually extracted. If the sampling is correct, samples are more likely to be representative of the population.

## Observational Unit
An **observational unit** is every individual in the sample or population. The total number of observational units is the sample or population size.

## Variable
A **variable** is an observable characteristic of a sample or population which we are interested in. A **variable's name** is always a uppercase latin letter, while **its values' names** are the lowercase letter with a numbered sub-index. The **value of a variable** obtained from a sample is not its true value, merely **one of all possible values it can take.** Each one of those values appears with a specific frequency. There are two kinds of variables:

- **Quantitative variables** represent a measurable (numeric) characteristic. They can be:
	+ Continuous: values range inside an interval of real numbers.
	+ Discrete: values are whole numbers.

- **Categorical variables** represent a non-measurable characteristic requiring verbal description. They can be:
	+ Ordinal: has a certain gradation or order to it (tall, medium, short).
	+ Non-ordinal: has no gradation or order.
