# El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)

The **El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)** is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific [[chen2024_enso-is-dominant-interannual-climate-variability-in-pacific|(@Chen2024)]]. The term *ENSO* really refers to two separate but closely related climate phenomena, El Niño/La Niña and the Southern Oscillation.

El Niño/La Niña is a natural, quasi-periodic climate variation that is dynamically centered in the equatorial Pacific [[talley2011_enso-definition|(@Talley2011)]], which oscillates irregularly between its warm phase, El Niño, and its cold phase, La Niña, peaking in boreal winter and recurring every two to seven years. The central-to-eastern tropical Pacific ocean warms during El Niño and cools in La Niña, causing large-scale changes in global oceanic and atmospheric circulation, effectively elevating the likelihood of extreme weather events globally such as cyclones and extreme rainfall [[santoso2017_enso-definition|(@Santoso2017)]].

The Southern Oscillation is an Interannual seesaw in tropical sea level pressure between the western and eastern Pacific, corresponding to a weakening and strengthening of the easterly trade winds over the tropical Pacific [[talley2011_enso-definition|(@Talley2011)]].

## The ENSO Cycle
ENSO can be described as an irregular cycle or oscillation between different oceanic and atmospheric conditions in the equatorial Pacific:

### Normal Conditions

During "normal" conditions, the easterly trade winds pile up warm equatorial water in the western tropical pacific and at the same time cause upwelling along the equator. This causes a *cold tongue* in sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern tropics, and causes the thermocline to be inclined upward from west to east. The warm-to-cold SST difference along the equator maintains the Walker circulation in the atmosphere, thus sustaining this component of the trade winds [[talley2011_enso-normal-conditions|(@Talley2011)]].

### El Niño Conditions

During an El Niño event, the trade winds are weaker, because the Walker circulation is weak or even reversed, and the thermocline is more level between the east and west. The *cold tongue* in the east weakens and dissapears, due to both relaxation of the thermocline and eastward movement of warm water from the central and western tropical Pacific [[talley2011_enso-el-nino-conditions|(@Talley2011)]].

### La Niña Conditions

La Niña is the exagerrated, strong version of the normal state. During La Niña, the warm SST shifts slightly more to the west, the thermocline is a bit deeper in the west and shallower in the east, and the Walker circulation in the atmosphere is stronger [[talley2011_enso-la-nina-conditions|(@Talley2011)]].

## Importance of ENSO

The impact of the 1997/98 El Niño was dramatic, and could translate to tens of thousands of human casualties worldwide and economic losses of tens of billions in US dollars. There were environmental disruptions such as devastating floods in Peru, mass coral bleaching events, and severe drought and forest fires in southeast Asia. Additionally, the 1998/99 extreme La Niña has been associated with catastrophic flooding events that claimed thousands of human lives in Bangladesh, Venezuela and China; and severe drought in the southwestern United States. An enhanced capacity to predict such inpactful events is a necessity, [[santoso2017_consequences-of-the-1998-1999-extreme-la-nina|(@Santoso2017)]].  

The global impacts of ENSO extend to land and marine habitats, water availability, food security, economics ,and social stability, underscoring the necessity to accurately predict ENSO well in advance for better management of resources and the associated risks, especially when they have been projected to increase in frequency under greenhouse forcing [[santoso2017_motivation-for-enso-research|(@Santoso2017; ]] [[santoso2017_consequences-of-the-1998-1999-extreme-la-nina|@Santoso2017)]].  

However, the shortness of modern observational record is a major impending issue. Although the spatial coverage of the observing system has been increasing over time, the temporal record is still too short to sufficiently constrain multi-year variability. Records deeper into the past can be obtained, but this involves dealing with large uncertainties; and paleo-oceanographic reconstructions are limited in spatial coverage and still have difficulty in accurately capturing individual ENSO events. Thus, every new observation presents a valuable opportunity to test the prevailing knowledge about ENSO and to review our progress towards a better unserstanding of this climate phenomenon [[santoso2017_shortness-of-enso-observational-record|(@Santoso2017)]].
