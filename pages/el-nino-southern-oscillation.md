# El Niño-Southern Oscillation

**El Niño/La Niña** is a natural climate variation that is dynamically centered in the tropical Pacific. Its "interannual" timescale is **3--7 years** for quasi-periodic alternation between the El Niño and La Niña states.

**The Southern Oscillation** is an interannual seesaw in tropical sea level pressure between the western and eastern Pacific, corresponding to a weakening and strengthening of the [easterly trade winds](/pages/easterly-trade-winds.md) over the tropical pacific. It is closely related to the El Niño/La Niña state.

Because the Southern Oscillation is so closely related to El Niño events, the full climate phenomenon is often referred to as **El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).**

## ENSO States

### "Normal" Conditions

The **"normal" oceanic and atmospheric conditions** in the tropical Pacific are as follows:

The easterly trade winds pile up warm equatorial water in the western tropical Pacific and at the same time cause upwelling along the equator. This causes a cold tongue in sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern tropics, and causes the thermocline to be inclined upward from west to east. The warm-to-cold SST difference along the equator maintains the [Walker circulation](/pageswalker-circulation.md) in the atmosphere, thus sustaining this component of the trade winds.

### La Niña Conditions

**La Niña** is the exagerrated, strong version of the normal state. During La Niña, the warm SST shifts slightly more to the west, the thermocline is a bit deeper in the west and shallower in the east, and the Walker circulation in the atmosphere is stronger.

### El Niño Conditions

During an **El Niño** event, the trade winds are weaker, because the Walker circulation is weak or even reversed, and the thermocline is more level between the east and west. The cold tongue in the east weakens and disappears, due to both relaxation of the thermocline and eastward movement of warm water from the central and western tropical Pacific.

## ENSO Mechanisms

The ocean and atmosphere are fully coupled in this climate "cycle". The coupling is referred to as the [Bjerknes feedback](/pages/bjerknes-feedback.md).

The alternation between El Niño and La Niña states is not regular since there are many different oceanic and atmospheric phenomena linked in the full system plus random, short-term forcing. The ENSO cycle is summarized [here](pages/enso_mechanisms.md).
