## Systems Approach Framework (SAF)

- Holistic approach to [coastal management](ur_coastal_zone_management) based on systems thinking.

- Several **weaknesses observed in [ICZM](integrated_coastal_zone_management)** case studies include:
	+ **Lack of a holistic approach**, leading to one-sectorial solutions.
	+ **Late and unbalanced stakeholder involvement** leading to public protest.
	+ Large **delay** between the **recognition** of a problem and the **implementation** of a solution, while increasing environmental pressures (climate change) demand a fast response time.
