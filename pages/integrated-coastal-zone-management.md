# Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)

**Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)** is a dynamic, continuous, and iterative process designed to promote sustainable management of coastal zones.

- Focus on the **land side of the coastal zone:** coastal plain and nearshore marine environment.
- **Ecosystem approach to coastal management** (seeing ecosystems as complex webs of interactions).
- **Critical Weakness (classically):** Long delay between the recognition of a problem and the implementation of a solution.

## Goals of ICZM:
* Economic development and human use of coastal zones.
* Protect, preserve and restore coastal zones.
* Minimize loss of life, property and infrastructure in coastal zones.
* Ensure public access to and enjoyment of coastal zones.
* All this within the limits set by natural dynamics and carrying capacity.

## The word *integrated* refers to integration of
* Multiple objectives.
* Multiple instruments and policies needed to meet those objectives.
* All relevant policy areas, sectors, and levels of administration.
* Multiple disciplines.
* Both terrestrial and marine components.

## Stepwise, circular, iterative process
1. Information collection
2. Stakeholder involvement
3. Development of measures
4. Decision making
5. Management

## ICZM in Europe:
* Broad thematic and geographic perspective.
* Long-term perspective.
* Adaptive management.
* Local specificity.
* Respect of carrying capacity of ecosystems.
* Public participation.
* Involvement of all relevant administrative bodies.
* Coherence between sectoral policies and between planning and management
* Focus on regional approaches.
* **No unified legal framework, ICZM enforced indirectly.**
