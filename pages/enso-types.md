# Types of ENSO

It has been increasingly recognized that **at least two different flavors or types of [ENSO](/pages/el-nino-southern-oscillation.md)** occur in the tropical Pacific:

- **Central Pacific El Niño-Southern Oscillation (CP ENSO)**
- **Eastern Pacific El Niño-Southern Oscillation (CP ENSO)**

In recent decades CP ENSO has been more common, possibly related to [anthropogenic forcing](/pages/human-environmental-impact.md) or [natural multidecadal variability](/pages/pacific-decadal-variability.md).
