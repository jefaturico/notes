# Statistics

**Statistics** is the study of the intrinsic properties of large sets. It attempts to analyze a [population](/pages/elements-of-statistics.md#population) using information obtained from [sampling](/pages/statistical-sampling.md).

## Branches of Statistics

### Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive** or deductive statistics is a field of statistics concerned with manipulating information obtained via sampling of a population in order for it to be understood and used easily.

**Frequency distribution** is the most important descriptive method to provide a global vision of a sample. This can be done graphically or through a frequency table, and the [variable](/pages/elements-of-statistics.md#variable) values in the sample can be ungrouped or grouped in intervals.

**Grouping values in intervals** is a great way to lessen the burden on visualization in large datasets. The procedure to group a variable's values into intervals is as follows:
1. Obtain the range: $R = V_{max} - V_{min}$
2. Choose the number of intervals: $N_i\approx 2\sqrt{N}$
3. Calculate the amplitude of each interval: $\frac{R}{N_i}$
4. Choose the upper and lower limits of each interval (usually .0 or .5 values)
5. Calculate the class midpoint: $m_i = lower\ value + \frac{upper\ value}{2}$

### Inferential Statistics

**Inferential** or inductive statistics is a field of statistics concerned with obtaining general forecasts on a population from the data obtained from a sample. It leans on descriptive statistics and calculation of probability.

**IMPORTANT:** The existence of a statistical relation between variables does not imply a cause and effect relationship.
