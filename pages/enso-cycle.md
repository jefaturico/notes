# The ENSO Cycle

**The [ENSO](el-nino-southern-oscillation) cycle**, based on Rasmusson & Carpenter (1982), Jin (1996) and Van der Waart et al. (2000) is very briefly summarized here.

## From Normal Conditions to El Niño

1. Weakening or reversal of the [trade winds](easterly-trade-winds), often associated with the atmosphere's 30--60 day [Madden-Julian oscillation](madden-julian-oscillation).

2. An oceanic [Kelvin wave](kelvin-waves) shoots eastward along the equator in response.

3. The Kelvin wave transports heat eastward, resulting in warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific.

4. Disruption of the [Walker circulation](walker-circulation) through sea surface temperature feedback on the atmosphere ([Bjerknes feedback](bjerknes-feedback)).

## From El Niño to La Niña

1. The Kelvin wave reflects at the eastern boundary and produces westward-popagating [Rossby waves](rossby-waves).

2. The Rossby waves move warm water away from the equator which weakens the equatorial warm sea surface temperature anomaly.

3. The trade winds strengthen a little in response to the somewhat cooler sea surface temperature in the west.

4. The strengthened trades begin pushing the thermocline back towards a normal state.

5. Bjerknes feedback creates a La Niña state.
