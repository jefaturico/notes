# Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)

Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) is a multidisciplinary, dynamic, and iterative process designed to promote the sustainable management of coastal zones.

The word *integrated* in ICZM refers to the process' integration (coming together) of:

* **Multiple objectives, instruments and policies**
* **Different policy areas, sectors and levels of administration**
* A **variety of disciplines** (multidisciplinary)
* **Both terrestrial and marine components.**

ICZM takes into account the **ecosystem approach to management**, an approach that goes beyond examining single issues, species, or ecosystem functions in isolation; instead **recognizing ecological systems for what they are: a rich mix of elements that interact with each other in important ways.**
