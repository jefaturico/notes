## Integrated Coastal Zone Management

40% of EU population lives on the coast.

Sea level rise is estimated to have been at 3.1 mm/year in the last decades

**Integrated Coastal Zone Management**: Dynamic, continuous and iterative process designed to promote sustainable management of coatal zones. It is the sustainable development of coastal zones, and takes into account the ecosystem approach to management.

<!-- What is Integrated Coastal Zone Management? -->
<!-- What does ICZM have to do with the exosystem approach to management? -->

Goals of ICZM are to balance the benefits from:
* Economic development and human uses of the coastal zones
* Protecting preserving and restoring coastal zones
* Minimizing loss of human life and property
* Public access to and enjoyment of the coastal zone, all within the limits set by natural dynamics and carrying capacity.

<!-- What are some of the goals of ICZM? -->

**Ecosystem-based Management**: approach that goes beyond examining single issues, species or ecosystem functions in isolation. Instead it recognizes ecological systems for what they are: a rich mix of elements that interact with each other in important ways.

<!-- What is ecosystem-based management? -->

**Integrated** Coastal Zone Management. The word *integrated* refers to the integration of:
  * Multiple objectives
  * Multiple instrumnts and polcies needed to meet these objectives
  * All relevant policy areas, sectors and levels of administration
  * Multiple disciplines
  * Terrestrial and marine components

<!-- What does the word "integration" refer to in "ICZM"? -->

A general definition of the "coastal zone" does not exist. Boundaries can vary between countries.

ICZM is a stepwise (happens in discrete steps), circular process covering aspects like:
  * Information collection
  * Stakeholder involvement
  * Development of measures
  * Decision making
  * Management

A separate, legally binding directive does not exist in Europe, but integrated management is demanded from different sides (international agreements, EU guidelines and directives, national landscape and spatial planning).

<!-- ICZM is a legally binding directive in Europe. True/False -->

A systems approach framework (SAF) for ICZM shall reduce the time that is needed between the recognition of a problem and the implementation of a solution. Climate change, sea level rise and other coastal pressures demand fast solutions, so we cannot spend 30 years from the recognition of a problem to its solution as has often happened in the past.

## Coastal Management --- A Systems Approach

Coastal systems are complex, and in order to be managed in a sustainable way a holistic approach is needed. Because of this IZCM was introduced in Europe in the 1990s.

In a review of existing ICZM case studies some weaknesses were observed. Common **weaknesses** include:
  * Lack of a holistic approach leading to one-sectorial solutions
  * Late and unbalanced stakeholder involvement leading to public protest
  * Long durations for the recognition of a problem to the implementation of a solution --- often decades. Now, increasing environmental pressures demand faster action.

The **systems approach framework (SAF)** is a *holistic approach* based on systems-thinking (looking at the whole system as opposed to single pieces of it).

The **ESE (Ecological-Social-Economic) Assessment** breaks down the ICZM cycle into six concrete steps.
