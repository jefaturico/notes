### How much time do I have in a day?

sleep = 8.0
exercise = 1.0
commute = 1.0
class = 2.0--6.5 ~ 3.25
food = 2.0
**minimum_spendature = 17.0** --> rounded up to account for other time wasters

**remaining_time = 7**
lecture_review = 2.0
independent_oceanography_skill_development = 1.0
reading = 1.0

youtube/music/movies/tv/videogames 2.0
remaining_time = 1.0 --> pretty much margin of error at this point
