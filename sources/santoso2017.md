The pronounced global impacts of ENSO extend to land and marine habitats, water availability, food security, economics, and social stabilty, thus underscoring the necessity to accurately predict ENSO well in advance for better management of resources and the associated risks. This has been the major motivation for intensive research into how ENSO operates.

the impact of the 1997/98 El Niño was dramatic which could translate to tens of thousands of human casualties worldwide and economic losses of tens of billions in US dollars. There were environmental disruptions such as devasatating floods in Peru, mass coral bleaching events, and evere drought and forest fires in southeast Asia. An enhanced capacity to predict such impactful events is a necessity, especially when they have been projected to increase in frquency under greenhouse forcing.

# santoso2017_shortness-of-enso-observational-record

The shortness of modern observational record has remained to be a major impending issue. That is, although the spatial coverage of our observing system has been increasing over time since the 1950s and particularly since the 70's when buoy and satellite observations became available, the temporal record is still too short to sufficiently constrain multi-year variability. Longer records deep into the past can be obtained, but this involves dealing with large uncertainties. Ocean observations prior to 1950 were sparse, for instance due to world war disruptions, and were affected by inhomogeneous ship recording practices. Paleo-reconstructions are limited in sptial coverage and still have difficulty in accurately capturing individual ENSO events, even though they can reasonably capture the statistics over a specific period. Thus, every new observation, in particular an emergence of a strong event, such as the 2015/16 El Niño, presents a valuable opportunity to test the prevailing knowledge about ENSO and to review our progress toward a better understanding of this profound climate phenomenon.

Generated in the qequatorial Pacific, ENSO vacillates irregularly between its warm phase, El Niño, and its cold phase, La Niña, peaking in boreal winter and recurring every two to seven years. The central-to-eastern tropical Pacific Ocean warms during an El Niño and cools in a La Niña, causing large-scale changes in ocean and atmospheric circulations within and outside the tropical Pacific, effectively elevating likelihood of extreme wather events globally such as cyclones and extreme rainfall.

There is also some paleo evidence indicating that twentieth-century ENSO variability appears stronger than that in the past centuries or millenia.

The 1982/83 and 1997/98 El Niños were not just the most intense in modern observational record, but also the most peculiar. They exhibit unusual characteristics distinct from any other observed El Niños. These include an eastward propagation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and particularly intense rainfall in the otherwise dry and cold eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Such characteristics have been exploited to identify extreme El Niño in climate models under present-day and future greenhouse forcing scenarios. These include an eastward propagation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and particularly intense rainfall in the otherwise dry and cold eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Such characteristics have been exploited to identify extreme El Niño in climate models under present-day and future greenhouse forcing scenarios. However, given the limited observed sample, it is not certin to what extent the observed characteristics are applicable to all extreme El Niño events. (...) In addition, it is not yet clear what other variables exist that can potentially be used in the event characterisation.

For instance, the 1998/99 extreme La Niña has been associated with catastrophic flooding events that claimed thousands of huan lives in bangladesh, Venezuela, and China; and severe drought in the southwestern United States, to name only a few.

The fact that the 1998/99 extreme La Niña immediately followed an extreme El Niño is concerning. For instance, the 1997-1999 swing of ENSO extremes resulted in a dramatic increased US agriculture economic loss from $1.5-1.7 billion in one year to $2.2-6.5 billion in the following year. Particularly concerning is that such swings from extreme El Niño to extreme La Niña have been projected to occur more frequently under greenhouse warming.
