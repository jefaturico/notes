# Central-Pacific El Niño-Southern Oscillation less predictable under greenhouse warming

@Chen2024

ENSO is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific.

A robust intensifying trend of the magnitude of sea surface temperature anomaly associated with ENSO variability has been projected in the next century under various emission scenarios.

ENSO's response to global warming has far-reaching implications for the global climate system, including slowing the rate of future mid-latitude Southern Ocean warming and accelerating Antarctic shelf ocean warming.

Here, using outputs from the latest climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we find a robust decrease of predictability of CP ENSO, associated with the increase of the spring predictability barrier (SPB) strength, suggesting less predictable CP ENSO in a future warming climate. In contrast, there is no significant change for EP ENSO predictability.

Since part of the ENSO predictability is contributed by the sea surface temperature anomaly persistence, the reduced persistence and increased strength of the spring persistence barrier of CP ENSO in a warming climate should contribute to reduced predictability.
