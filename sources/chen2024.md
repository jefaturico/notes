ENSO is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability in the tropical Pacific [@Chen2024].

A robust intensifying trend of the magnitude of sea surface temperature anomaly associated with ENSO variability has been projected in the next century under various emission scenarios [@Chen2024].

ENSO's response to global warming has far-reaching implications for the global climate system, including slowing the rate of future mid-latitude Southern Ocean warming and accelerating Antarctic shelf ocean warming [@Chen2024].

!! Here, using outputs from the latest climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we find a robust decrease of predictability of CP ENSO, associated with the increase of the spring predictability barrier (SPB) strength, suggesting less predictable CP ENSO in a future warming climate. In contrast, there is no significant change for EP ENSO predictability [@Chen2024].

Since part of the ENSO predictability is contributed by the sea surface temperature anomaly persistence, the reduced persistence and increased strength of the spring persistence barrier of CP ENSO in a warming climate should contribute to reduced predictability [@Chen2024].

!! These results suggest that CP ENSO predictability will likely decrease, mainly due to the difficulty of prediction to pass through the boreal spring in a future warming climate [@Chen2024].

!! Increased SPB strength and earlier SPB timing of CP ENSO suggest that the future CP ENSO predictability will decline to a certain level in an earlier timing. Therefore, CP ENSO will be more unpredictable in the future [@Chen2024]. 

For the future climate, the ACC of CP ENSO is significantly reduced compared to the present-day climate when the forecast is made through the boreal spring, leading to a stronger SPB and reduced predictability [@Chen2024].

The persistence barrier and SPB strength in the recharge oscillator model vary with $a_21$ and $a_22$. When $a_21$ decreases (stronger damping of the system), the strengths of the persistence barrier and SPB both strengthen. HOwever, when $a_22$ increases (stronger coupling effect of thermocline depth on SSTA), the strength increases for the persistence barrier, but decreases for the SPB. For the relationshop between the persistence barrier and SPB strength in the recharge oscillator model, the role of decreasing $a_21$ and and increasing $a_22$ is opposite, consistent with previous findings. This implies that the ehanced CP ENSO SPB strength under global warming is caused by the decreasing $a_21$ via increasing the CP ENSO damping rate [@Chen2024].

The reduced predictability of CP ENSO under greenhouse warming appears to be caused by a stronger ENSO damping rate, as encapsulated by $a_21$ in the ROM. ENSO damping rates are affected by multiple air-sea feedbacks, which include three positive feedbacks of zonal advective feedback (ZA), thermocline feedback (TH), and Ekman feedback (EK), and two negative feedbacks of thermodynamical damping (TD) and dynamical damping (DD), as well as extratropical impact. Our calculation of each feedback shows that global warming tends to enhance the three positive feedbacks as well as the North Pacific impact for CP ENSO. HOwever, these effects are overwhelmeed by the even stronger increase of negative feedbacks for CP ENSO, which leads to a net increase of the CP damping rate [@Chen2024].

The increased negative feedback is dominated by the increase of thermodynamic daming (TD), while the fynamic damping is not changed significantly. Therefore, TD plays an important role in reducing CP ENSO growth rate and predictability. (...) Under greenhouse warming, the warming in SSTA enhances the TD via increased latent heat loss and deep clouds, acting to reduce the persistence and predictability, and in turn, increasing persistence barrier and SPB strength of CP ENSO. The thermofynamic dmaping is strengthened so much that it overwhelms the enhanced predictability from the North Pacific [@Chen2024].

In response to future greenhouse warming, we find that, across the latext CMIP6 models, predictability will be reduced for CP ENSO, but remain little changed for EP ENSO. The strength of the spring persistence barrier and SPB will be increased by 20% and 25% in the future, respectively. The predictability of CP ENSO is suppressed by the enhanced thermodynamic damping and the resulting decreasing growth rate. Furthermore, since CP ENSO frequency may be increased under greenhouse warming, the CP ENSO may become the dominant mode of ENSO in the future. Our study, therefore, suggests that the prediction of CP ENSO will be more challenging in the future under global warming, which may lead to the reduced predictability of climate worldwide [@Chen2024].
