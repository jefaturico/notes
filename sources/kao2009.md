### Summary Transcribed

Two different types of ENSO are described and contrasted in this paper based on their spatial structure: one centered in the eastern Pacific and the other in the central Pacific. Composite analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis are applied to identify the positive and negative phases of these two SST-anomaly structures.

The EP-ENSO resembles the canonical ENSO and follows the evolution described by the delayed-oscillator theory. It appears to be a basin-wide coupled phenomenon that depends on thermocline variations for both its growth and its phase reversal.

The CP-ENSO, by contrast, has most of its major SST, surface-wind, and subsurface-temperature anomalies located in the central equatorial Pacific. It involves only a shallow subsurface layer (about 100 m) and appears to develop from the surface, implying that local atmospheric forcing—such as the Madden–Julian Oscillation or the Asian/Australian monsoons—is important for its generation. Unlike the EP-ENSO, the CP-ENSO does not exhibit a clear phase-reversal feature during its evolution.

These two ENSO types also show different teleconnections with the Indian Ocean: the EP-ENSO is more closely linked with the tropical Indian Ocean, while the CP-ENSO is more closely linked with the southern Indian Ocean.

Composite analysis further shows that the warm and cold phases of the CP-ENSO tend to share similar physical characteristics and spatial patterns. Their evolution and phase-locking behavior are also similar, suggesting that the CP El Niño and La Niña arise from a common physical process. For the EP-ENSO, the differences between its warm and cold phases mainly reflect differences in intensity; otherwise, they exhibit similar patterns and evolution. The weaker magnitude of EP-La Niña compared to EP-El Niño may result from the subsurface thermal structure. Cold water in the eastern equatorial Pacific typically originates from upwelling, and the temperature below the thermocline does not differ greatly from the SST of the cold-tongue region. Therefore, negative SST anomalies are limited by the weak vertical temperature gradient. Warm anomalies, in contrast, originate from the warm-pool region, where water is much warmer than in the cold tongue. As a result, El Niño events in the cold-tongue region tend to be more intense than La Niña events there.

These results indicate that more than one type of ENSO may exist in the tropical Pacific, an idea also proposed by Ashok et al. (2007). The principal-component time series of the CP-ENSO identified here correlates strongly (correlation coefficient 0.82) with the El Niño Modoki Index defined to detect non-canonical ENSO events. That index is based on the contrast between SST anomalies in the central Pacific and those in the eastern and western Pacific.

Nevertheless, further analysis is needed to clarify the underlying dynamics of the two ENSO types and to determine whether they represent distinct modes of tropical interannual variability. It is also possible th
at they arise from nonlinear properties of a single ENSO dynamic mode. Recent studies (e.g., Rodgers et al. 2004; An and Jin 2004; Schopf and Burgman 2006) show that nonlinearity can produce spatial asymmetries between El Niño and La Niña phases. Harrison and Schopf (1984) also suggested that SST anomalies may appear in the central or eastern Pacific depending on the season of Kelvin-wave propagation. The different onset times found here for EP- and CP-ENSO may relate to that argument.

The results of this paper suggest a need to define new ENSO indices for improved monitoring of the different types of ENSO activity.
