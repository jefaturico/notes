The shortness of modern observational record has remained to be a major impending issue. That is, although the spatial coverage of our observing system has been increasing over time since the 1950s and particularly since the 70's when buoy and satellite observations became available, the temporal record is still too short to sufficiently constrain multi-year variability. Longer records deep into the past can be obtained, but this involves dealing with large uncertainties. Ocean observations prior to 1950 were sparse, for instance due to world war disruptions, and were affected by inhomogeneous ship recording practices. Paleo-reconstructions are limited in sptial coverage and still have difficulty in accurately capturing individual ENSO events, even though they can reasonably capture the statistics over a specific period. Thus, every new observation, in particular an emergence of a strong event, such as the 2015/16 El Niño, presents a valuable opportunity to test the prevailing knowledge about ENSO and to review our progress toward a better understanding of this profound climate phenomenon [@Santoso2017].
