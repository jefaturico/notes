The persistence barrier and spring predictability barrier (SPB) strength in the recharge oscillator model vary with $a_{21}$ and $a_{22}$. When $a_{21}$ decreases (stronger damping of the system), the strengths of the persistence barrier and SPB both strengthen. However, when $a_{22}$ increases (stronger coupling effect of thermocline depth on SSTA), the strength increases for the persistence barrier, but decreases for the SPB. For the relationship between the persistence barrier and SPB strength in the recharge oscillator model, the role of decreasing $a_{21}$ and and increasing $a_{22}$ is opposite, consistent with previous findings. This implies that the ehanced CP ENSO SPB strength under global warming is caused by the decreasing $a_{21}$ via increasing the CP ENSO damping rate [@Chen2024].
