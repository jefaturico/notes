Using a comprehensive ocean model coupled to a simple atmospheric model, Blanke et al. (1997) examined the effect of stochastic winds on ENSO irregularity.  Without stochastic  wind forcing, a regular self-sustained oscillation was produced, indicated by a sharp spectral peak; whereas with weather noise the spectral peak broadened substantially, resembling the observed.  In the real system, stochasticity can manifest in the form of “wind bursts” –  episodic but sustained reversals or enhancements of winds about the equator for several days, which can be due to various factors, such as tropical cyclones and Madden Julian Oscillation .  Wind bursts can trigger ENSO development and influence its eventual fate, depending on the characteristics of the wind bursts (e.g., strength, timing,  location) as well as the prevailing background condition of the tropical Pacific.  Such stochastic forcings ultimately lead to diversity in ENSO strength, patterns, and  timing.  On the other hand, other studies such as  Münnich et al. demonstrate that stochastic forcing alone is not the only source of  aperiodicity, but another contender is chaos stemming from non-linearity in the deterministic system [@Santoso2017].
