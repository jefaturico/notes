The seasonality property is also reflected in the predictability of ENSO.  The so-called “spring predictability barrier” exists in which ENSO  forecast skill drops off dramatically over boreal spring than any other seasons in the year.  This appears to be also associated with the annual cycle in the  growth rate of ENSO.  For instance, Levine and McPhaden found that spring  predictability barrier exists in a conceptual recharge oscillator model only when the ENSO  growth rate is set to vary seasonally [@Santoso2017].
