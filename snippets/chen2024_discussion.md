In response to future greenhouse warming, we find that, across the latest CMIP6 models, predictability will be reduced for CP ENSO, but remain little changed for EP ENSO. The strength of the spring persistence barrier and spring predictability barrier (SPB) will be increased by 20% and 25% in the future, respectively. The predictability of CP ENSO is suppressed by the enhanced thermodynamic damping and the resulting decreasing growth rate. Furthermore, since CP ENSO frequency may be increased under greenhouse warming, the CP ENSO may become the dominant mode of ENSO in the future. Our study, therefore, suggests that the prediction of CP ENSO will be more challenging in the future under global warming, which may lead to the reduced predictability of climate worldwide [@Chen2024].
