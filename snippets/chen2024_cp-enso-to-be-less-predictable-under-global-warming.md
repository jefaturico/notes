# chen2024_cp-enso-to-be-less-predictable-under-global-warming

Here, using outputs from the latest climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), we find a robust decrease of predictability of CP ENSO, associated with the increase of the spring predictability barrier (SPB) strength, suggesting less predictable CP ENSO in a future warming climate. In contrast, there is no significant change for EP ENSO predictability [@Chen2024].

These results suggest that CP ENSO predictability will likely decrease, mainly due to the difficulty of prediction to pass through the boreal spring in a future warming climate [@Chen2024].

Increased SPB strength and earlier SPB timing of CP ENSO suggest that the future CP ENSO predictability will decline to a certain level in an earlier timing. Therefore, CP ENSO will be more unpredictable in the future [@Chen2024].
