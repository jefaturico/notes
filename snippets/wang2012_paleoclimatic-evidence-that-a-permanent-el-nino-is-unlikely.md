The east-west SST contrast in the Pacific that we see today may not be a stable and permanent feature. Paleoclimatic records suggest that during the warm early Pliocene (4.5 to 3.0 million years ago) the average SST contrast was about 2ºC, similar to the contrast seen during a modern El Niño event. Because the early Pliocene was warmer than today, this suggests that the equatorial Pacific could see a reduction in east-west SST contrast as the Earth warms up in response to increasing greehouse gases. (...) However, available Pliocene records show that ENSO frequency and amplitude were not significantly different from today  [@Wang2012].
