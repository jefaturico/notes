There may be two types of ENSO: 1) an eastern-Pacific (EP) type that is located in the central tropical Pacific and whose generation mechanism involves thermocline variations along the equatorial Pacific and 2) a central-Pacific (CP) type that is located in the central tropical Pacific and whose generation is not sensitive to the thermocline variations [@Kao2009].
