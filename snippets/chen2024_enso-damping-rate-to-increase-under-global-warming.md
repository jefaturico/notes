The reduced predictability of CP ENSO under greenhouse warming appears to be caused by a stronger ENSO damping rate, as encapsulated by $a_{21}$ in the ROM. ENSO damping rates are affected by multiple air-sea feedbacks, which include three positive feedbacks of zonal advective feedback (ZA), thermocline feedback (TH), and Ekman feedback (EK), and two negative feedbacks of thermodynamical damping (TD) and dynamical damping (DD), as well as extratropical impact. Our calculation of each feedback shows that global warming tends to enhance the three positive feedbacks as well as the North Pacific impact for CP ENSO. However, these effects are overwhelmeed by the even stronger increase of negative feedbacks for CP ENSO, which leads to a net increase of the CP damping rate [@Chen2024].

The increased negative feedback is dominated by the increase of thermodynamic daming (TD), while the dynamic damping is not changed significantly. Therefore, TD plays an important role in reducing CP ENSO growth rate and predictability. (...) Under greenhouse warming, the warming in SSTA enhances the TD via increased latent heat loss and deep clouds, acting to reduce the persistence and predictability, and in turn, increasing persistence barrier and spring predictability barrier (SPB) strength of CP ENSO. The thermodynamic damping is strengthened so much that it overwhelms the enhanced predictability from the North Pacific [@Chen2024].
