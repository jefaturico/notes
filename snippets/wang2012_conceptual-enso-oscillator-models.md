A negative feedback is needed to turn the coupled ocean-atmosphere system around from an El Niño state back towards a normal or La Niña state. In search of necessary feedbacks for the coupled system, four conceptual ENSO oscillator models have been proposed the delayed oscillator, the recharge oscillator, the western Pacific oscillator, and the advective-reflective oscillator. These oscillator models respectively emphasized the negative feedbacks of reflected Kelvin waves at the ocean western boundary, a discharge process due to Sverdrup transport, western Pacific wind-forced Kelvin waves, and anomalous zonal advection. These negative feedbacks may work together for terminating El Niño warming, as suggested by the unified oscillator [@Wang2012].
