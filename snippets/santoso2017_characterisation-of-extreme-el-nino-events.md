The 1982/83 and 1997/98 El Niños were not just the most intense in modern observational record, but also the most peculiar. They exhibit unusual characteristics distinct from any other observed El Niños. These include an eastward propagation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and particularly intense rainfall in the otherwise dry and cold eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Such characteristics have been exploited to identify extreme El Niño in climate models under present-day and future greenhouse forcing scenarios. These include an eastward propagation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and particularly intense rainfall in the otherwise dry and cold eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Such characteristics have been exploited to identify extreme El Niño in climate models under present-day and future greenhouse forcing scenarios. However, given the limited observed sample, it is not certin to what extent the observed characteristics are applicable to all extreme El Niño events. (...) In addition, it is not yet clear what other variables exist that can potentially be used in the event characterisation [@Santoso2017].
