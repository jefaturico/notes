- ## Integrated Coastal Zone Management

	- **Integrated Coastal Zone Management:** Dynamic, continuous and iterative process designed to promote sustainable [management of coastal zones](ur_coastal_zone_management). It is the sustainable development of coastal zones, and takes into account the [ecosystem approach to coastal management](ecosystem_based_management).

	- The goals of ICZM are to balance the benefits from:
	  + Economic development and human uses of the coastal zones
	  + Protecting preserving and restoring coastal zones
	  + Minimizing loss of human life and property
	  + Public access to and enjoyment of the coastal zone, all within the limits set by natural dynamics and carrying capacity.

	- **Integrated** Coastal Zone Management. The word *integrated* refers to the integration of:
	  + Multiple objectives
	  + Multiple instrumnts and polcies needed to meet these objectives
	  + All relevant policy areas, sectors and levels of administration
	  + Multiple disciplines
	  + Terrestrial and marine components

	- A general definition of the "coastal zone" does not exist. Boundaries can vary between countries.
	- ICZM is a stepwise (happens in discrete steps), circular process covering aspects like:
	  + Information collection
	  + Stakeholder involvement
	  + Development of measures
	  + Decision making
	  + Management

	- A separate, legally binding directive does not exist in Europe, but integrated management is demanded from different sides (international agreements, EU guidelines and directives, national landscape and spatial planning).

	- A systems approach framework (SAF) for ICZM shall reduce the time that is needed between the recognition of a problem and the implementation of a solution. Climate change, sea level rise and other coastal pressures demand fast solutions, so we cannot spend 30 years from the recognition of a problem to its solution as has often happened in the past.
