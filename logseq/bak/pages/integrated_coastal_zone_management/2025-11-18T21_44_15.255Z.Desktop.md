- ## Integrated Coastal Zone Management

	- **Integrated Coastal Zone Management:** Dynamic, continuous and iterative process designed to promote sustainable [management of coastal zones](ur_coastal_zone_management). It is the sustainable development of :scoastal zones, and takes into account the [ecosystem approach to coastal management](ecosystem_based_management).

	- The **goals of ICZM** are to balance the benefits from:
		+ Economic development and human uses of the coastal zones
		+ Protecting preserving and restoring coastal zones
		+ Minimizing loss of human life and property
		+ Public access to and enjoyment of the coastal zone, all within the limits set by natural dynamics and carrying capacity.

	- **The word *integrated*** refers to the integration of:
		+ Multiple objectives
		+ Multiple instruments and polcies needed to meet these objectives
		+ All relevant policy areas, sectors and levels of administration
		+ Multiple disciplines
		+ Terrestrial and marine components

	- **ICZM is a stepwise, circular process** covering aspects like:
		+ Information collection
		+ Stakeholder involvement
		+ Development of measures
		+ Decision making
		+ Management

	- **A separate, legally binding directive does not exist in Europe**, but integrated management is demanded from different sides/pages/systems_approach_framework.md (international agreements, EU guidelines and directives, national landscape and spatial planning).

	- A [Systems Approach Framework (SAF)](systems_approach_framework.md) for ICZM shall reduce the time that is needed between the recognition of a problem and the implementation of a solution. Climate change, sea level rise and other coastal pressures demand fast solutions, so we cannot spend 30 years from the recognition of a problem to its solution as has often happened in the past.
